			<p>This documentation is available for version 2.1.x. For any updates, please visit our website.</p>
            <h4>Files and Folders Structure</h4>
            <p>In your zip archive you have 3 folders: "Admin", "Documentation" and "Frontend-Template"</p>
			<p><b>Admin folder</b>: here are all files required for administration area. Upload this folder to your server. Optionaly, you can rename this folder (do not forget to change folder name in config.php file if you rename it).</p>
			<p><b>FrontEnd-Template folder</b>. Here you have all website template files. You can upload files inside this folder to your location where you want to install website template (in root, in separate folder or subdomain). Please note that it is a separate config.php file that you must edit. It is not required to use our template but it is a good start if you want to build a complex template that will use content added in our Pike Admin administration area.</p>

            <h4>Requirements</h4>
            <p>- PHP 5.3+ with pdo extension enabled (it is default enabled)<br />
			- MySQL database<br />
			- Web server with ModRewrite support (if you use Apache server, you have a .htaccess file which you must upload)<br />
			- Script require a domain name (or subdomain) to be installed.</p>
			
            <h4>Installation</h4>
            <p>STEP 1: Unzip and copy script files and folders on the server (using an FTP program).</p>

			<p>STEP 2: Create a database and a user for that database (eg. in cPanel -> MySQL Databases)</p>

			<p>STEP 3: Import tables file (/admin/install/tables.sql). Steps to import a file: - go to phpMyAdmin (or another database management script) - select your database - click on "Import" button - choose file to upload (located in /admin/install/tables.sql) - upload (import) file</p>

			<p>STEP 4: Edit the file "config.php" located in "admin" folder and add database connect details and url where you uploaded the "admin" folder.</p>

			<p>STEP 5: Make writable (chmod 777) folder "uploads" folder and all subfolders ("avatars", "images", "large", "small", "temp")</p>
			
			<p>STEP 6: Login in admin area. Default admin connection details are: demo@pikephp.com (as email) and 123456 (as password). You can change this details in admin area (my profile).</p>
			
			<p>STEP 7 (required for frontend-template only): If you want to use our default front-end template, you can upload files inside "frontend-template" to your server. Don't forget to upload .htacess file (located in root of "frontend-template"folder). Also you need to edit settings in config.php file located in "frontend-templae" folder too.</p>
			
			<p>IMPORTANT: <br />
			- It is strongly recomended to use a SMTP server to manage sending emails (related to users registration, forget password, activate account...). We recomend using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mailgun.com">Mailgun SMTP server</a>.<br />
			- It is strongly recomended to use Google reCAPTCHA API to prevent spam related to users registration and contact messages. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/">Get reCAPTCHA keys</a>.<br />
			If you want support to setup and integrate this products in your software, you can contact us (note that this will be a paid support).

            <h4>FAQ</h4>
            <p><b>I want to edit / delete or add pages in admin area</b></p>
			<p>Admin pages are located in "templates-pages" folder inside admin folder. Left sidebar (with all admin sections links) are located in "sidebar.php" file.</p>
			<p>If you add / edit a page, keep in mind that the same filename must be present in sidebar.php</p>
			<p>Example: in sidebar if you have a link like <pre><code>... href="account.php?page=my-custom-page ...</code></pre>The filename inside "templates-pages" must be "my-custom-page.php"</p>

			<p><b>Users roles</b></p>
			<p>We didn't implement users roles and separate template files depending on permission. It is your responsability to code this. All users roles have access to all pages.</p>
